description: One of the key components in Transformers Revival is, as the name suggests, transformations. Not only between robot mode and vehicle mode, but also between robot arm and various weapons. The transformations work in a special way that makes them fully seamless:<br><br>All modes use the exact same 3D model, only difference being the rotations and offsets of each cube; all other properties, such as dimensions, UV mappings, and names stay the same. For each mode, a “snapshot” is first taken of the model, and its rotation and offset data is saved. With the cubes sharing the same names across snapshots, the model can easily be morphed between snapshot states using linear interpolation.
