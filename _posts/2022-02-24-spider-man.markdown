description: Spider-Man’s web swinging took a lot of tweaking and fine-tuning to get right, but is ultimately pretty straight-forward:<br><br>After the player shoots a web rope and that rope attaches to a surface, the rope stays a fixed length (ignoring elasticity). Whenever the player’s distance from the attachment point (point <em>A</em>) exceeds the established fixed length, their position in the world (point <em>B</em>) is offset to close that gap, while still maintaining the angle between the two points. A tangent vector can then be created by making a line between them, the direction of which is then applied to the player as motion, thus creating the “swing” motion.
